# Pokerstars (Vegas Infinite) Matchlog Analyzer
I recently found out that pokerstars saves your matches in a log file. I found this file rather unorganized so this simple script parses it into a nice and readable json format.

I might add more to this in the future, programs that use the parsed data to display stats etc.

## Fair warning
This is a work in progress and has no guarantee it'll keep working forever.

I also started this in the middle of my exams (like one always does) so code might be messy.
